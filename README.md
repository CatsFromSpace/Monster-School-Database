# Monster School Database

## Overview and Learning Outcome
This project was a lesson in utilizing Entity Framework within Visual Studio to create a database, and interact with it using a console app to display data from the table. This project creates and connects to a local database: MonsterSchoolDB, which is a fun dark fantasy twist on a normal school student roster database.
